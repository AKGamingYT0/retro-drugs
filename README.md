# retro-drugs
FiveM resource that adds opportunity to deal drugs to NPCs with NPC Voice lines

First of all drag and drop this resource to your resource foldel.
Now if you using **ox_inventory** copy the items you need of items.lua file (in current resource) and simply paste them to the table in items.lua (in ox_ivnventory/data folder) and don't forget images for your items. Or you can simply define your own drungs!
For those who want to use another inventory, you can try doing Ñ‹imilarly with your inventory (paste copied items to where they are stored), but you might need to chage the way how they are defined (especially additional buttons I use in this case to call an export form the resource)
